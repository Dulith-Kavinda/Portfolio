# My Portfolio

## Overview
This portfolio website is a dynamic and interactive experience built using modern web technologies. It is designed to showcase my projects and skills while providing a platform for connection and feedback. The site is a single-page application built with React, leveraging the power of React Router 6 for efficient navigation, GSAP for smooth animations, and Tailwind CSS for a responsive, utility-first design.

## Core Features

### Interactive 3D Graphics
The site features a visually stunning 3D slider that animates in response to scrolling. This immersive element adds a unique and modern touch to the user experience, providing a memorable way to navigate through key projects or sections.

### Collaborative Feedback & Chat
A built-in chat system allows visitors to send direct feedback or inquiries. As the owner, I can reply to these messages directly within the chat, creating a two-way communication channel for quick and easy collaboration. 

### Blog & Posts
A dedicated section displays my blog posts. Each post can be liked by any visitor, with the total like count updating in real-time. To make it easy to find specific content, users can filter the posts by category or topic.
